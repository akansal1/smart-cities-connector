      <h3>Welcome to CE 88 Data Science for Smart Cities</h3>
 

<p>Cities become more dependent on the data flows that connect infrastructures between themselves, and users to infrastructures. Design and operation of smart, efficient and resilient cities nowadays require data science skills. This course provides an introduction to working with data generated within transportation systems, power grids, communication networks, as well as collected via crowd-sensing and remote sensing technologies, to build demand- and supply-side urban services based on data analytics.</p>

<p>The Foundations of Data Science course provides a baseline of computing skills, statistical concepts, and data visualization, including basic geospatial data presentation. This connector extends these aspects in the domain of data analysis and signal processing methods essential for the operation of urban infrastructures. It augments the foundations of data science with concepts that are specific to the design and operation of services for managing transportation, power, water, and communication infrastructures, as well as studying their environmental and economic impact. It has both an application and a technical depth aspect.</p>

<p>During the first two weeks of the term it provides a background in data analysis in engineering of cities. Next 3 weeks introduce data collection and sensing technologies, and prepare the students for the data analysis block of the course. We will explore methods for acquisition, processing and analysis of urban data, and overview data mining techniques used in data analytics. Data analysis is the core of the course that lasts for 4 weeks. It starts from human behavior data analysis to forecast demand on a range of infrastructures, and then strengthens a body of computational and statistical skills necessary to monitor and manage the infrastructures on the supply side. We will then overview methods to assess environmental footprint of cities. Data analysis block is followed by 2 weeks block where we introduce the concepts of optimal control and demand management. Finally, in the concluding 2 weeks, we will consider the economic impact of human behaviors and infrastructure performance in cities. The course will be concluded within the final two weeks when we will establish connections and identify trade-offs of multi-criteria decision-making in infrastructure planning and operation.</p>

<p>An important aspect of this course is its range of examples of data analysis presented in ipython notebook environment. It is designed to provide hands-on experience with how human behavior can be studied to forecast demand on transportation infrastructures, what it means for inter-connected networks and the environmental footprint of a city, and how the performance of transportation and utility networks in response to this demand can be analyzed and managed. The final project will involve thoughtful adaptation of the code samples presented in class and assignments into a consistent data analysis workflow that allows making conclusions regarding a stated problem.</p>
