    "include the following:\n",
    "<li>33 percent of retail electricity from renewable power by 2020, and 50% renewable by 2030; <li>greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal to 1990 levels by 2020;<li>regulations in the next 4-9 years requiring power plants that use coastal water for cooling to either repower, retrofit or retire; <li>policies to increase distributed generation; and <li>an executive order for 1.5 million zero emission vehicles by 2025.\n",

    "\n",
    "These initiatives are great, but can provide some real challenges when it comes to implementation. Why?\n",
    "1. For the grid to function correctly, the energy supplied must exactly equal the energy demand at all times. If energy generation does not equal demand, the grid can have failures and blackouts. \n",
    "2. Over generation is as bad as under generation. \n",
    "3. The grid does not deal well with large/rapid fluctuations in energy usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate predictions of demand and prediction of generation from renewable sources is crucial to stabilizing the grid. We have provided data on hourly energy demand for the state of California as well as solar and wind energy generation for the state for the month of March 2016 from [CA ISO](http://oasis.caiso.com/). In this minilab we will explore the energy datasets and will explore some of the challenges with reaching the initiatives.\n"
